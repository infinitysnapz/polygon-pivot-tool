## Install Instructions
Download and move the unzipped folder in your project addons folder.

If you use git you can also add it as a submodule:

## Usage

|Action|Key|
|-|-|
|Set Point|left mouse click|
|Add Point|right mouse click|
|Cancel|esc|
|Move pivot|enter / return|

The blue point represents the average position of all points and represents the pivot.

If you rightclick near a corner, this tool will add the nearest corner as a point.
It should be noted that unfortunately this tool acts weird with already rotated, or scaled polygons however.

## Donate

If you find this tool useful consider buying the original creator of 'knife-tool-2D' a coffee- I just very quickly hacked this together for my own needs, and it shows.:
